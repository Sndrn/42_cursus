# About

The purpose of this project is the discovery in detail UNIX mechanism - pipe.


## Description

The program pipex should repeat the behaviour of the next shell command

$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2

and looks like this:

$> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

All errors like: wrong commands, permission to files and etc, need be handle.
