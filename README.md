# 42_cursus

## About 42
42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process : the so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

## Skills developed at 42cursus
### Hard-skills

- C/C++ language, Makefile
- Shell scripting
- Git
- Networks
- Docker
- SQL
- Web (HTML, CSS, Wordpress)
- Computer graphics
- Assembly language

### Soft-skills

- Self-learning and proactivity
	At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

- Teamwork
	Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
	work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
	levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
	contribute to the project.
  
- Time management and resiliency
	The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
	demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" in the
	massive load of work demanded by the program.
  
 ## 42's Curriculum
 
42 cursus includes two groups of projects: the first one being known as "inner circle" and the second one, "outer treks".

- The inner circle is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

- The outer treks is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
