# About

This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the printf function.

For more information, please refer to the subject [ft_printf](https://github.com/Sndrn/42_cursus/tree/main/Subjects_PDFs).


    The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
    You have to recode the libc’s printf function
    It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
    It will manage the following conversions: c s p d i u x X
    It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field width with all conversions
    It will be compared with the real printf
    You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool is forbidden.
