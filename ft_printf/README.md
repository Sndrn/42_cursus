# About

This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the printf function.

For more information, please refer to the subject [ft_printf](https://github.com/Sndrn/42_cursus/tree/main/Subjects_PDFs).


    The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
    You have to recode the libc’s printf function
    It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
    It will manage the following conversions: c s p d i u x X
    It will be compared with the real printf
