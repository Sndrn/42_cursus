# About

This is the first graphic project at 42.

The aim of this project is to create a small 2D game where players have to pick up all collectables and go to the exit making as few moves as possible.

It is built to make you work with textures, sprites and some very basic gameplay elements using MinilibX (a simple graphic library that is use at 42).
